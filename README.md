# teach-la-go-backend

Hey there! This is the repo for our experimental Go Backend, which we're using for our online editor. Eventually, the goal of this project is to replace [the current Express-based backend](https://github.com/uclaacm/TeachLAJSBackend), bringing it up to feature parity and using all the benefits that Go provides!
